# BouligandStationarityLowRankOptimization

This repository contains Matlab implementations of the following low-rank optimization methods:
- monotone PGD [OW25, Algorithm 4.2 with l = 0 or p = 1];
- P2GD [SU15, Algorithm 3];
- four classes of ERFD (whose iteration map is [OA24, Algorithm 3.1]), namely RFD [SU15, Algorithm 4] and CRFD [OA24, Definition 6.3] with each of the three cones from [OA24, Table 6.1];
- P2GDR [OGA24, Definition 6.1];
- P2GD-PGD [OGA24, Definition 7.1];
- four classes of ERFDR [OA24, Algorithm 4.2], namely RFDR [OA23, Algorithm 3] and CRFDR [OA24, Definition 6.3] with each of the three cones from [OA24, Table 6.1];
- HRTR [LKB23, Algorithm 1].

It also contains Matlab code enabling to check the Hessian and the Matlab scripts used to realize the numerical experiment presented in [OGA24, section 8.3], which compares empirically monotone PGD, P2GD, RFD, P2GDR, P2GD-PGD, RFDR, and HRTR on the weighted low-rank approximation (WLRA) problem studied in [OGA24, section 8.2].

Every Matlab function implements:
- the iteration map if its name contains “map”;
- the iterative method returning all iterates and function values generated over a prefixed number of iterations if its name contains “iterinfo”;
- the running time needed to bring the function value below a prefixed threshold if its name contains “time”.
These functions are called by the script Time_obj_WLRA.m that has generated the files WLRA_time_obj_data_randn.mat, which contains the data of the problem studied in [OGA24, section 8.3], and WLRA_time_obj_randn.mat, which contains the results presented in the tables from [OGA24, section 8.3]. The figures from [OGA24, section 8.3] were generated by the script Time_obj_WLRA_plot.

The script CheckHessianLKB23.m calls the functions CheckHessian.m and CheckHessianLift.m.
